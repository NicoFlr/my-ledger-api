# My Ledger API



##  ðŸ“‹ Pre-Requirements


The tools required to develop on this project are:

* [.NET 8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) 
* [SQL Server Developer Free edition](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads)
* [SQL Server Management Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-ver16#download-ssms)
* [Visual Studio Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)

## ðŸ”Œ Configurations

### SQL Server Management Studio

To connect to your local server in the credentials input the following data:

  * Server name: (LocalDB)\MSSQLLocalDB
  * Authentication: Windows Authentication
  * Trust Server Certificate: âœ…

Click on the Connect button and you should be able to see all your local databases.

### Creating local database for local testing and development
Inside Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio:

* Right-click on the **Databases** folder and select the **New Database...** option
* Give it the following name: **MyLedgerDB**
* Click **OK**

Now from the root folder of the application:

* Navigate to the **Scripts** folder
* Copy the contents of **Schema.sql**

Back on Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio:
* Right-click the newly created Database and select the **New Query** option
* Paste the contents of **Schema.sql**
* Click on the **Execute** button

### Populate local database with sample data

* Copy the contents of **Data.sql** from the **Scripts** folder onto a new Query on the database and execute it.

### Export Models

If you want to export your models in the database to your models in the code use the following command:

```dotnet ef dbcontext scaffold "Server=(localDBServerName)\mssqllocaldb;Database=MyLedgerDB;Trusted_Connection=True;TrustServerCertificate=True;" Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer -o Models```

But if you want to update your models in your code with recently updated database changes use the following command:

```dotnet ef dbcontext scaffold "Server=(localDBServerName)\mssqllocaldb;Database=MyLedgerDB;Trusted_Connection=True;TrustServerCertificate=True;" Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer -o Models -f```

Where (localdb) is the name of your local SQL server

**At the moment of updating the models, the constructor and the onConfiguring method will be reset, so save it in a notepad and put it back to the MyLedgerDbContext.cs file**

**Warning Note:**
If, at the moment of running one of the mentioned commands you have a login error, run the following query in your database. This command will change the owner from the database to your local Windows user: 

```sh
Use <database_name>
GO
sp_changedbowner '<user_name>'
GO
```

To see your user name press the view connection properties in the connection.

## ðŸ’¿ Install Dependencies
